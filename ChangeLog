CHANGELOG FOR BLACKFISH PROJECT

Current Version

 - hiding of Cisco CDP protocol frames (parameter -Hcdp)
 - fixed LLC handling
 - RIP and RIPv2 routing protocols supported

Version 1.2

 - hiding of the ethernet loopback frames supported, usefull when dealing
   with Cisco routers that periodically send such frames over ethernet to
   check if layer 2 connection is still alive (parametr -Hel)
 - modyfied look of icmp6 packets in v2 and v3 modes
 - new verbose mode (v3+) shows all info that is shown by v3 mode plus data
   caried by tcp, udp and icmp protocols
 - modyfied look of icmp packets in v2 and v3 modes
 - bfish has been ported fot Linux operation system 
 - bfish has been ported for IBM AIX operation system
 - new verbose mode 3+ that prints all of mode 3 information and data caried
   by tcp and udp protocols
 - HEX output mode now prints 16 values each line
 - HEX output mode now prints blank line after each frame
 - changed llok of 3 verbosity mode in IP handler to show more info about
   FRAG and TOS fields
 - SHOST and DHOST for ethernet and IEEE 802.3 changed to SRC and DST
 - tcp and udp cksum computing corrected
 - 'Router Selection' ICMP message name corrected to 'Router Solicitation'
 - bfish is now fully based on the netz sdk
 - TOS display bit 0 corrected
 - net and netinet header files abandoned for new netz network support sdk
 - 'alternate checksum request' and 'alternate checksum data' TCP options added
 - 'POC permit' and 'POC service profile' TCP options added
 - IP view improved to provide more detailed information 
 - ARP protocol packet look improved
 - added support for Novell's proprietary 802.3 RAW frame
 - added support for IEEE 802.3 SNAP
 - added support for IEEE 802.2 LLC protocol
 - added support for IEEE 802.1q VLAN tagging
 - added support for IEEE 802.3 frames
 - type specific informations added to ICMP handler in verbose mode 3
 - traceroute ip option support added
 - source and destination address labels changed to 'SRC' and 'DST' for IP and
   Ethernet protocols
 - ICMPv6 support added
 - minor ANSI C, NetBSD and FreeBSD compatibility errors fixed, so bfish
   is capable to compile and work under NetBSD and FreeBSD as well as
   under OpenBSD !!! ;)
 - validation for correct (RFC894) ethernet frames added, other stuff are not
   displayed
 - more ethertypes correctly displayed
 - IPv6 over IPv4 supported as well as IPv6 over IPv6, IPv4 over IPv6 and
   IPv4 over IPv4 (last one was supported earlier)
 - basic support for IPv6 added, currently only main IPv6 header is recognized
 - much faster computing of TCP/UDP checksum implemented, now ip pseudo
   checksum is computed by IP/IPv6 handler and its given to TCP/UDP handler
   so there is no need to do time consuming packet copying to compute it 
 - PROTO changed to PR in verbose mode 3 for IPv4 protocol 
 - added version field in verbose mode 3 for IPv4 protocol
 - new output modes added, raw mode '-mr{2|3|4|5}' and hex mode '-mh{2|3|4|5}'
 - all controll messages are displayed on stderr, stdout is reserved for packet
   analiser output only
 - direct output to a file added, options '-o' and '-O'
 - changed choosing of output mode, now there is one new option for it '-m'
   '-v' and '-s' options are no longer present, instead can be used '-mv{1|2|3}'
   and '-ms{1|2|3}'
 - UDP special mode 3 fixed, now shows data length
 - TCP Sack option bug fixed
 - IP Xsecurity option bug fixed

Version 1.1 
 
 - help added, at least ;)
 - improved support for IP and TCP options
 - support for interfaces that haven't assigned IPv4 address,
   stealth sniffing ;)
 - default capture length is now set automatically according to mtu value
   of interface, it makes us sure to default capture of whole packet
 - mtu value discovering for choosen interface added
 - added support for udp packets witchout cksum, now cksum in these packets is
   reported as 'NONE'
 - basic support for ip options added (still under development) 
 - new support for tcp otions (still under development), now options can
   be displayed in few lines
 - pcap messages modyfied
 - showing of chosen interface name added
 - capture length option added '-c'

Version 1.0 - first published version
