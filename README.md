# BlackFish - OpenBSD network sniffer

My first network related project. BlackFish is a packet sniffer developed originally on OpenBSD UNIX system and later ported to IBM AIX and now in Linux. This was the very project that started my networking career. No active development, just more like vintage curiosity. Named after BlackFish USV :)
